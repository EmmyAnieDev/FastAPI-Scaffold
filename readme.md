## Environment Setup

### Using Poetry (Recommended)

1. Install Poetry if you haven't already:
```bash
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - --version 1.8.2
```

2. Add Poetry to PATH:
```bash
  export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

3. Verify Poetry installation:
```bash
  poetry --version
```

4. Create a virtual environment with Poetry:
```bash
  poetry env use python3.10  # or your preferred Python version
```

5. Install dependencies:
```bash
  poetry install
```

6. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
  poetry shell
```

>  Alternatively, you can run commands within the virtual environment without activating it:
```bash
  poetry run <command>
```

### Using Standard Python venv

1. **Create a virtual environment**:  

```bash
  python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:  

- On macOS/Linux:  

```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
```

- On Windows (PowerShell):  

```bash
  .venv\Scripts\Activate
```

3. **Install Poetry (if not already installed)**:
